Pie & donut charts

Subplots & figure layouts

Adding titles, labels, legends, and annotations

Styling with colors, grids, themes

üéØGoal

The goal of this repo is to:

Practice different types of visualizations

Build strong foundations in Matplotlib

Use it later in Data Analysis & Machine Learning projects
